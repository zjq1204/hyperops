# The CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT setting determines the message content types that
# Celery can accept. Setting it to ['json'] means that Celery only accepts JSON
# formatted message content. By default, Celery supports multiple content types
# (such as pickle, json, yaml, msgpack). Using JSON is for security and
# compatibility reasons. JSON format is lightweight, cross-platform, and less
# likely to cause potential security issues (such as pickle deserialization
# vulnerabilities).

# The CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER setting specifies how Celery serializes the task
# message content. Setting it to 'json' means that Celery will serialize the
# task content into JSON format. The purpose of this is to ensure that the task
# content can be transmitted and stored across platforms. JSON is a universal,
# lightweight serialization format that can transfer data between different
# languages and systems. Other optional serialization formats include pickle
# (not recommended, may have security risks), msgpack (more efficient
# compression), and yaml (more readable but less efficient).

# is beneficial. Default is number of CPUs, but for I/O-bound tasks,
# you can set it higher (e.g., 2-4x CPU count)
